# Unit 3 - Lesson 2

## List Processing and Functional Abstractions in JavaScript

### Essential Questions
* Explain what it means that functions are _first-class citizens_ in JavaScript.
* What are _higher-order functions_ and how does this result from the concept of first-class functions?
* Thus far, how have we abstracted over _data_? How have we abstracted over _actions_ (particularly, actions performed on data)?
* How do JavaScript's higher-order array methods allow us to further leverage abstraction?
* What is functional programming and what are its benefits?

### Vocabulary
* abstraction
* first-class functions
* higher-order functions
* callback function
* functional programming
* programming _paradigm_
* pure function
* side effects
* composability  
* (im)mutability

### Key Methods
* `Array.prototype.forEach()` 
* `Array.prototype.map()`
* `Array.prototype.filter()`
* `Array.prototype.reduce()`
* `Array.prototype.sort()`
* `Array.prototype.some()`
* `Array.prototype.every()`
